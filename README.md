# XinuOS_Process_Handling
This is the Project#1 of ECE565 at NC State

Two coding problems were solved and passed testcases successfully
    1. Cascading termination: Group processes in two categories: system processes and user processes. Modify the 'kill' function to perform cascading termination for user              processes only.
    
    2. Process creation and stack handling: Implement a 'fork()' system call similar to Unix'fork.
